Crypto Clusters

Our goal was to use unsupervised machine learning to clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.

  1.We starting by importing Crypto Data into our note book, and turning it into a DataFrame .

  2.We then found the optimal K to try so we we would have an idea of what the most efficent number of clusters would be.

  3.We then put the sklearn model to work and graphed the results.

  4.Afterwards we filtered out some of the data we did not need using PCA.

  5.We then put the model to work again on the filtered data.

  6.Finally we compared results between the two

  7.The filtered Data provided a cleaner picture of the clusters
